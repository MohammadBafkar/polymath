# Project localization — `.polymath/project.yaml`

**Schema:** [`registry/schemas/project.schema.json`](../registry/schemas/project.schema.json).
**Loader:** [`plugins/polymath-core/hooks/scripts/load-project-context.py`](../plugins/polymath-core/hooks/scripts/load-project-context.py).
**Skill:** [`polymath-core:project-context`](../plugins/polymath-core/skills/project-context/SKILL.md).
**Examples:** [`.polymath/examples/`](../.polymath/examples/) — dotnet, python, typescript, java, go.

## Why this exists

Without project localization, Polymath skills ship generic guidance.
The `code-review` skill produces the same checklist for a .NET 8
service and a Go service. The `verify-change` skill defaults to a
language it had no way to know about.

`.polymath/project.yaml` at the root of your repo tells the catalog:

- **Stack** — languages, testing frameworks, build tool, runtime,
  database, package manager.
- **Conventions** — commit style, branch strategy, code-review
  checklist path, language-specific style files.
- **External skills** — pointer to other catalogs (e.g.
  `github.com/dotnet/skills`) the project recommends installing.
- **Skill overrides** — per-skill additional context, additional
  review axes, and test commands.
- **Prompts** — pointers to project-owned PR / postmortem / PRD / ADR
  templates skills should prefer over their built-in versions.
- **Setup** — context sources, required local tools, environment
  variable names, and first steps for a new contributor or coding
  agent. Secret values never belong here.
- **Polymath activation** — recommended Polymath plugins, useful
  workflows, and compatible agent surfaces for this repo.

Capability resolution is owned by `.polymath/capabilities.yaml`
(separate file, separate schema, resolved by its conventional path; see
[`docs/CAPABILITIES.md`](CAPABILITIES.md)).

The polymath-core SessionStart hook loads this file, validates it, and
writes a resolved snapshot to
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/polymath-core/project-context.json`. Skills read
that snapshot and adapt.

## Quick start

1. Run `/polymath-core:init-project` in the target repo, or pick the
   closest example from [`.polymath/examples/`](../.polymath/examples/).
2. If using an example, copy it to `.polymath/project.yaml` at the root
   of your repo.
3. Edit values for your project — `project.name`, stack details,
   conventions paths.
4. Start a new Claude Code session; the SessionStart hook emits a
   one-line summary like:

```text
Polymath: project context loaded. Languages: dotnet 8 (aspnet-core) · Tests: xunit + nsubstitute + fluentassertions · Runtime: kubernetes · External skills: github.com/dotnet/skills
```

Skills that consume the context adapt to your stack.

### Localization fields and their consumers

`conventions_docs` is consumed today by seven skills (code-review,
verify-change, feature-dev, api-design-rest, db-schema, dockerize,
ci-pipeline-github — the contract lives in
`polymath-core:project-context`); `prompts` templates by
`polymath-release:pr` and `polymath-incident:postmortem-blameless`.
`smoke` (per-language boot-verification recipes) is consumed by the
workflow runner's `appStarts` gate: a workflow check that starts the app
from the frozen snapshot's recipe and verifies readiness, resolving
non-blocking `not-applicable` when the repo declares no recipe (see
[WORKFLOW-SCHEMA § 4](WORKFLOW-SCHEMA.md)). `tracker` (work-item
destination + provenance marking; the provider itself comes from
`.polymath/capabilities.yaml`, secrets never live here) is consumed by
the polymath-tracker skills: destination defaults plus 3-layer
provenance marking (title prefix, tag, traceability footer), readback
verification after create, and HITL-only pushes — the contract lives in
`polymath-core:project-context`. `routing.mode` (`hint` is the default
ambient behavior; `classify`/`enforce` activate the opt-in
`polymath-pipeline` plugin — classify directive, intake skill, and the
enforce gate that blocks mutating tool calls until the request is
classified). `provenance.runs: true` makes `polymath-flow` whole-copy
each completed run record into `.polymath/runs/<run_id>/` (fail-open,
default off). `attribution` is consumed as opt-in visibility markers:
`chat_markers: true` makes localizing skills prefix their primary
output with an origin marker, and `commit_trailer` is appended by
`polymath-release:commit` (absent/empty = no trailer). Future keys
degrade gracefully: the loader warns and ignores unknown top-level keys
instead of failing.

## Convention packs

A project (or a defaults pack — org, team, or project-archetype scope) encodes its house reality as a small corpus of
convention documents that skills resolve **by role** through
`conventions_docs` — so the catalog stays generic and the project supplies
the specifics. Skeleton templates ship in
`plugins/polymath-core/templates/conventions/`: `knowledge-base.md`
(canonical-source registry + domain map), `stack-doc.md` (one per area:
backend, frontend, database, auth, deployment, shared-libraries),
`review-checklist.md`, and `artifact-matrix.md` (work-type × scope →
required artifacts).

Conventional role names skills look for: `knowledge-base`, `backend-stack`,
`frontend-stack`, `database`, `auth`, `deployment`, `shared-libraries`,
`review-checklist`, `artifact-matrix`, `api-style`. Keys are free-form —
declare any role; only the names above have wired consumers today.

### The `[VERIFY: …]` marker protocol

Convention corpora are working derivations of canonical sources (wikis,
ADRs, the team's heads). Any statement that was inferred — by
`init-project` scanning code, or by an author writing from memory — and
not confirmed against its canonical source carries an inline
`[VERIFY: <question>]` marker. The contract:

- A consuming skill must not treat a marked item as authoritative.
- When a marked item affects a decision the skill is making, it surfaces
  the marker to the user at that decision point instead of silently
  relying on it.
- Confirming an item removes the marker; each doc collects its open
  markers in a trailing "Open questions" section so teams can burn them
  down deliberately.
- An obsolete convention doc gets a `[DEPRECATED: <date> — see <url>]`
  header and stays in place. This applies to project/org convention
  corpora only — Polymath's own docs stay stateless.

## Resolution order

The loader looks for `project.yaml` in this order, first hit wins:

1. `./.polymath/project.yaml` (project, repo-root)
2. `${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR}/polymath/project.yaml` (user / team default)
3. `~/.polymath/project.yaml` (last-resort user default)

There is no merge between these layers — the winning file is used whole.

### Machine-local overlay

`./.polymath/project.local.yaml` (repo-root, gitignored — add it to the
repo's `.gitignore`) is deep-merged on top of the winning file: mappings
merge per key with the overlay winning, lists and scalars are replaced.
It carries personal, this-machine-only tweaks; never secrets. The overlay
is fail-open: a malformed or invalid overlay is warned on stderr and
skipped, never failing the session. When no base file resolves at all, a
valid overlay serves as the sole source. `_meta.overlay` in the snapshot
records the overlay path when one applied.

## Project workflows and routing

Two more project-local surfaces localize *routing*, not just skill
behavior. Both are fail-open: malformed files are ignored and can never
break a session.

### Workflow discoverability

Workflows in `./.claude/polymath/workflows/` (project layer) and
`${CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR}/polymath/workflows/` (user layer) have always been
*runnable* — `polymath-flow start` resolves project → user → marketplace.
The polymath-flows SessionStart hook also makes them *proposable*: it
indexes both tiers into a machine-local fragment
(`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/polymath-flows/workflow-index.project.json`) and
appends a "Project workflows" block to the injected catalog index. Rules:

- A workflow needs a one-line `whenToUse` to be indexed (same grace rule
  as the catalog index); unindexed workflows stay runnable by name.
- The injected name is the **file stem** — the handle `polymath-flow
  start` actually resolves. When the YAML `name:` differs from the stem,
  the stem wins and the divergence is recorded in the fragment
  (`declaredName`); `flatten --out` warns when it writes such a file.
- The project tier shadows the user tier on a name collision; a name
  matching a catalog workflow is annotated as overriding it (that is the
  localization use-case — `polymath-flow flatten` a partial over the
  catalog parent into this layer, see
  [WORKFLOW-SCHEMA § 3](WORKFLOW-SCHEMA.md)).
- A trigger phrase colliding with a catalog trigger (or an
  earlier-tier entry) is **dropped** from the fragment — recorded in its
  `dropped_triggers`, never an error. The catalog keeps the phrase;
  WORKFLOW-2's marketplace-wide trigger uniqueness is unaffected.

### Routing-signal overlay

`./.polymath/route-signals.project.json` (checked in — it encodes team
reality, not machine state) adds project-specific rules to the ambient
route-hint hook, same shape as the bundled table:

```json
{
  "rules": [
    {
      "id": "acmeDeploy",
      "kind": "skill",
      "surface": "acme:deploy-runbook",
      "regex": ["\\bACME-\\d+\\b"],
      "intents": ["deploy the acme stack"]
    }
  ]
}
```

Overlay rules are scored together with the catalog's; on an equal score
the project rule wins the tie and is labeled `project overlay` in the
hint. Each rule is sanitized on load: signal fields must be **lists of
strings** (a bare string is dropped, never iterated per-character),
`url`/`regex` patterns that do not compile are dropped (one bad pattern
cannot take the hook down), `trust` is stripped (a project file can
never claim an elevated trust axis), and a rule left with no `surface`
or no signal (`url`/`regex`/`paths`/`diff`/`intents`) is skipped. The
overlay is capped at 50 rules. The SURFACE-2 uniqueness gate stays
marketplace-internal — an overlay may deliberately duplicate a catalog
intent and the scorer resolves it at runtime.

## Validation

The loader enforces a minimal subset of the JSON schema at session
start:

- `schemaVersion: 1` (required).
- Unknown top-level keys are warned and dropped — recorded in
  `_meta.ignored_keys` — so a file written for a newer schema (or
  carrying a typo) degrades gracefully instead of failing the session.
- `stack.languages` must be a non-empty list of objects each
  containing `lang`.
- `conventions.commit_style` ∈ `{conventional-commits, free-form,
  ticket-prefixed}`.
- `conventions.branch_strategy` ∈ `{trunk-based, gitflow, github-flow,
  release-branch}`.
- `external_skills[*]` must declare `source`. `install`, when
  present, must be one of `{marketplace, manual, submodule}`.
- `setup.required_tools[*]` and `setup.environment[*]`, when present,
  must declare `name`.
- `polymath.recommended_plugins[*]`, when present, must declare `name`.

A bad file exits the loader with code 2 and surfaces the violations
on stderr — the existing snapshot is left untouched so the previous
good context still applies. The SessionStart hook continues; other
surfaces (paused workflows, scheduled work) still render.

The full JSON schema is the source of truth for CI; the in-loader
validator has the same shape, trimmed for the runtime check.

## Versioning & refresh

`schemaVersion` is `1`, and the loader accepts only `1`. There is no
automatic migration: if a future Polymath release bumps the schema, an old
file keeps working as long as it still validates against the version the loader
accepts. **The supported refresh path is to re-run `/polymath-core:init-project`**
— it re-inspects the repo and rewrites `.polymath/project.yaml` at the current
schema version, preserving your explicit intent where it can. When the schema
version advances, that release's CHANGELOG names what changed and whether a
re-run is required; the loader's exit-2 validation errors tell you which fields
to fix if you would rather edit by hand.

## How skills consume the context

Skills read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/polymath-core/project-context.json`.
The file mirrors the user's `.polymath/project.yaml` with a `_meta`
block added (source path, load time, schema version). Example:

```bash
ctx="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA:-$HOME/.claude/plugins/data}/polymath-core/project-context.json"
if [[ -f "$ctx" ]]; then
  primary_lang="$(python3 -c "import json,sys; d=json.load(open(sys.argv[1])); print(d.get('stack',{}).get('languages',[{}])[0].get('lang',''))" "$ctx")"
fi
```

The highest-leverage skills to adapt:

- **`polymath-engineering:code-review`** — append review axes from
  `skill_overrides["polymath-engineering:code-review"].additional_axes`;
  cite the project's code-review checklist + language-specific style
  file.
- **`polymath-engineering:verify-change`** — pick the test command
  from `skill_overrides["polymath-engineering:verify-change"].test_commands`
  matching the project's primary language.
- **`polymath-release:pr`** — use `prompts.pr_description_template`
  when set instead of the catalog default.
- **`polymath-incident:postmortem-blameless`** — use
  `prompts.postmortem_template` when set.

Skills that don't consume the context still work — they just produce
generic guidance.

## External skill recommendations

The `external_skills` section lets a project tell contributors which
other catalogs to install:

```yaml
external_skills:
  - source: github.com/dotnet/skills
    plugins: [dotnet, dotnet-aspnet, dotnet-test, dotnet-data, dotnet-msbuild]
    install: marketplace
```

The SessionStart hook surfaces this in its summary line so a new
contributor sees them. Installation itself is out of scope for
Polymath — follow the external catalog's own instructions.

The framing is **delegation**: Polymath does not compete with
`dotnet/skills` on .NET depth. The project says "for .NET use
`dotnet/skills`; Polymath provides the SDLC workflow on top of that."

## Project activation

Use `polymath-core:initialize-project` or
`/polymath-flows:run-workflow activateProject` to create the first
project file for an existing repo. The initializer reads local
instructions, docs, CI, package manifests, and deployment files, then
writes:

- `.polymath/project.yaml` with stack, conventions, setup, Polymath
  recommendations, and skill overrides.
- `.polymath/capabilities.yaml` when providers can be inferred with
  confidence.
- `docs/POLYMATH-ONBOARDING.md` with required tools, environment
  variable names, recommended plugin install sets, useful workflows,
  portability notes, and open questions.

The initializer must not store secret values and must not guess unknown
capability providers.

## Capability mapping (sibling file)

Capability resolution lives in `.polymath/capabilities.yaml`
(see [`docs/CAPABILITIES.md`](CAPABILITIES.md)). The two files are
siblings under `.polymath/` and `project.yaml` does not duplicate or
point at the capability data: the runner resolves `capabilities.yaml`
by its conventional path directly. A project without `capabilities.yaml`
simply doesn't get capability resolution — workflows that need it fail
clearly at start time.

## Per-session, not per-message

The loader runs once per Claude Code session (at SessionStart). If
you edit `.polymath/project.yaml` mid-session, restart Claude Code to
pick up the change.

## What this does **not** do

- Install external skill plugins for you — that's manual.
- Cross-validate against `.polymath/capabilities.yaml`.
- Run the skill overrides automatically — skills read the snapshot
  and apply the overrides themselves.
- Provide a UI for editing — copy an example and edit YAML directly.
