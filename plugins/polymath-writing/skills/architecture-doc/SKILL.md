# architecture-doc

> Author a C4-style architecture doc. Layers used: System Context (L1), Containers (L2), Components (L3 when interesting). L4 (code) is omitted by default.

## When to use

- A new system needs an architecture doc.
- An existing doc is stale and someone is about to read it.
- A workflow needs to capture the design before significant new work.

## Procedure

1. Read [`Architecture-doc.md`](../../templates/Architecture-doc.md).
2. Draft `docs/architecture/<system>.md`:
   - **Purpose** — who reads this, what decisions it grounds.
   - **System context (L1)** — the system in relation to users + external systems. Mermaid diagram.
   - **Containers (L2)** — deployable units (services, databases, queues, frontends). Table + diagram.
   - **Components (L3)** — only if the most interesting container has enough internal structure to warrant it.
   - **Cross-cutting concerns** — AuthN/Z, observability, data classification, failure modes.
3. Link related ADRs and the originating PRD.

## Quality bar

- L1 + L2 diagrams are present and current.
- The container table cites tech and responsibility per container.
- L4 (code) is **not** present unless the user asked for it. C4 says skip it by default.
- Cross-cutting concerns are concrete (named systems, not "we use observability").

## Output

- File: `docs/architecture/<system>.md`.
- Summary listing the C4 levels included and the number of containers documented.
